/*
This 'for loop' will keep on running until 'i' becomes 0..
The loop runs in following steps:~
    1. ‘i’ is initialized to 5.
    2. The condition “i” (0 or none) is tested.
    3. The code is executed.
    4. ‘i’ is decremented.
    5. Condition ‘i’ is checked & code is executed if it’s not 0.
    6. And so on until ‘i’ is non 0.
